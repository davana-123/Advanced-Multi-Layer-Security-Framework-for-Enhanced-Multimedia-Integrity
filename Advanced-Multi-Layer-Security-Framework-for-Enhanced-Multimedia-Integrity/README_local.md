# Advanced-Multi-Layer-Security-Framework-for-Enhanced-Multimedia-Integrity
Designed a secure communication system using hybrid cryptography (AES + RSA) and LSB steganography to protect multimedia data like images, audio, and video. Ensured real-time processing, multiple key encryption, and safe data embedding to prevent tampering and eavesdropping during video communication.
